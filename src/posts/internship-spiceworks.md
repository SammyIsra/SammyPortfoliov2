## What it is

My internship at Spiceworks was my first experience in the tech industry, and it was easily the most influential experience in my University career. In Spiceworks I had my first mentor figure, [Alex Wykoff](https://twitter.com/alex_wykoff) (Hi Alex!). Alex taught me the first things I learned about the development cycle, Meteor, QA, and User Experience. Also the importance of presentation and public speaking. 

## What I did

At Spiceworks, we developed the groundwork for a continuous integration platform built specifically for Spiceworks projects. In the three months that I was there, we went from an empty Meteor project to presenting a working UI that showed results from manually ran tests in real time.

## What we used

The front end application was built with Meteor, so we had a strong focus on JavaScript (by then ES5), HTML and CSS. The tests that were ran for Spiceworks projects were written in Ruby, with a heavy focus on headless browser testing.
