## What it is
[GitPoint](https://gitpoint.co/) GitPoint is the most feature-rich unofficial GitHub client that is 100% free. 

Is an open source mobile GitHub client for Android and iPhone. In it, I am a contributor and active member of the community.

GitPoint is free for everyone and a fantastic use case for React Native ⚛️.

## What it does
The mobile application is built with React Native + Redux.

The application fetches all data from GitHub's GraphQL API. 

The community is all managed in GitHub, and chats happen in Glitter.
