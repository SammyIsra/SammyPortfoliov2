## What it is 

Fred is a chat bot built on the [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com) framework. It was initially generated by [`generator-hubot`](https://github.com/github/generator-hubot), and configured to be deployed on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). The scripts are built in JavaScript and CoffeeScript. 

Some notable commands include:

- `fred analyze` Fred analyzes the sentiment of a string with IBM's Watson and sends to the chat a detailed analysis of the string. The results are later hosted in a MongoDB instance and displayed nicely [here](http://fredanalyze.surge.sh/).
- `fred weather` Fred checks the weather and shows it to the caller. Fred can also check for the forecast of the next week (forecast thanks to Andrew Hopper).
- `fred garage` Also developed by Andrew Hopper, Fred scraps UCF Parking's website to find the best garage to park at.

## What I did

I first bootstrapped the project with generator-hubot as mentioned before and set up the development and deployment pipelines. I am now in charge of managing the public repo and develop, along with my friends, the scripts that make this bot tick.
