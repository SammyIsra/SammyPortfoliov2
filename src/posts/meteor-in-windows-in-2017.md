## What it is

The Status of Meteor on 2017 is an article I wrote for Dev.to. The idea of the article is to explore how easy it is to start and publish a Meteor project in Windows. 

The project itself is nothing important or challenging since what I wanted to explore and show was Meteor.

I've had some experience with the framework before, which is why I was both excited and worried about the article: Windows has never been (or doesn't feel like it has been) a main concern for the good folks that develop Meteor. 

While there were some hurdles (and some mistakes on my part), in the article we ended up successfully installing, creating, and deploying a Meteor application to Heroku.
