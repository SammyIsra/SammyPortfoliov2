## What it is
Mobile application developed on Ionic that allows students to schedule and find study sessions in their campus.

## What we used
I was in charge of developing the mobile client, with focus on Android. I was also partly in charge of designing the UX/UI, and the guidelines to use in future development of the app, and developing the deployment and workflow pipelines. 

The mobile client was developed in Ionic, and the web client was Angular. Because of Ionic's use of Angular, much of the code was shared between mobile and web clients. The back end was a .Net web API.
