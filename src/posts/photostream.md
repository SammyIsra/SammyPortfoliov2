## What it is

Simple React package that allows the display of multiple images in columns without any gaps inbetween, regardless of image size.

The developer passes to the component a list of images. They also have the option to also pass an event handler and the individual image component for further customization. 

## What I used

Written in JavaScript, built with React, bootstrapped with [NWB](https://github.com/insin/nwb). The code is hosted in [Github](https://github.com/SammyIsra/photostream-react), and it goes thru an instance of TravisCI to ensure that it can be built and that it works. It is deployed to [NPM ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-photostream) and there is a demo available in this website.
