## What I did

I have been an intern in Precision Infinity for almost a year, where I have worked in the development of both client projects and internal products. I Improved on and built new features for employee and contract management web solutions. I also lead the development of new features and improvements for a Visual Studio plugin designed to automate the build pipeline, called Automatic Versions.

## What I used

All applications I worked on were built on the .Net framework, so most (if not all) of my time at Precision Infinity I used C#, WPF, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
