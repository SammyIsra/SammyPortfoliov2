## What it is

A tiny Node CLI tool to make sure you don't forget anything. Slightly glorified todo checklist. 

Easy to set up and use! Intended to fire before important events from the CLI (committing your code or deploying a built) and run the developer through a checklist before greenlighting the event.

## What I used

Written in TypeScript, and it heavily leverages [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/) and [inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/). The code is hosted in [Github](https://github.com/SammyIsra/ChecklistChecker). It is deployed to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prefly).
