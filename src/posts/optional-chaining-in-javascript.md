# What it is

This is an article hosted on dev.to about Optional Chaining, a syntax specification I am particularly fond of, mostly for the fact that it is a feature of C# that I wish I could use everywhere else. 

The article talks about the status of the proposal, why we need it, how it looks, and a little bit on how it works. I also go into how to use the feature as of the writing of the article. 

While not in the article itself, in the comment section I also mentioned why it has not yet passed to Stage 2 and the current issues the committee is facing with this proposal.
